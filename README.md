# Swing

### A Python implementation of automatic swing trading execution algorithm.

## Features

* Automatically reverse positions while market price swings in a pre-defined range.
* Swing range is split into price zones to gradually increase or decrease holding positions to reduce risk and smooth out capital usage.
* Grid-based oscillatory trading in each price zone by trailing stop.
* Advanced adaptive order type reduces timing risk with 4 excecution modes: `PATIENT, ACCELERATED, URGENT, PANIC`, used for long/short
reversal, stop loss and profit taking.
* Automatic stop for loss cut or profit taking.
